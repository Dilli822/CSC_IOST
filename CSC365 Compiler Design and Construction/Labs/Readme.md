| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Lab 1      |  Creating the java file and compiling using **cmd is javac filename.java** and running the compiled or Compiled Bytecode Files that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can execute using the command java filename, since java is platform independent and you can use cmd to check and compare the compilation and execution times of Java program **time javac filename**
| Lab 2      | Using the -Xint option in Java disables the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, forcing the JVM to interpret the bytecode instead of compiling it to native machine code. While this doesnâ€™t disable the Java compiler (javac), it changes how the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode. When to Use -Xint Testing or Debugging: To identify issues that might be caused by the JIT compiler. Special Environments: If the system has constraints or incompatibilities with the JIT compiler. **Cmd is: 1. javac HelloWorld.java 2. java -Xint ClassName**
