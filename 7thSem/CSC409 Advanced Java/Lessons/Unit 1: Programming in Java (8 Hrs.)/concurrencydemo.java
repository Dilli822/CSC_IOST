// ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:
// Thread States:

// NEW: Threads are created (MyThread t1 = new MyThread();).

// RUNNABLE: After calling start(), threads become runnable.

// RUNNING: Threads execute their run() method.

// BLOCKED: The thread waits for a synchronized block (in synchronized(System.out)).

// TERMINATED: Once run() completes, the thread terminates.

// Multithreaded Program:

// Threads are created using MyThread t1 = new MyThread(); and run using start() method.

// Three threads are demonstrated, each printing a message with a delay (Thread.sleep(500)).

// Thread Properties:

// Thread Name: t1.setName("Thread-1") sets the thread name.

// Thread Priority: t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY) sets the priority of threads. 
// Threads with higher priority (e.g., Thread.MAX_PRIORITY) are scheduled more frequently.

// Thread Synchronization:

// Synchronized Block: synchronized(System.out) ensures that only one thread writes to System.out at a time, 
// avoiding mixed outputs.

// This is a simple example of thread synchronization.

// Thread Priorities:

// Threads have priority values between Thread.MIN_PRIORITY (1) and Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (10). 
// Here, Thread-2 has the highest priority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY), Thread-1 has the lowest (Thread.MIN_PRIORITY), 
// and Thread-3 has a normal priority (Thread.NORM_PRIORITY).

// ðŸ§  Key Points to Remember:
// Thread states change from NEW â†’ RUNNABLE â†’ RUNNING â†’ BLOCKED â†’ TERMINATED.

// Thread priority affects how the thread is scheduled but does not guarantee order.

// Synchronization prevents race conditions and ensures that only one thread at a time can access a resource.

// Use start() to begin a thread and join() to ensure one thread waits for others to finish before proceeding.
