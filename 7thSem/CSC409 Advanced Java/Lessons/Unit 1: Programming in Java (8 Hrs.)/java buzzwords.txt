"Java buzzwords" are key features or principles that describe the core design goals of the Java programming language. These were popularized by Sun Microsystems to highlight what makes Java unique.

ðŸ”‘ Common Java Buzzwords:
Simple â€“ Easy to learn, especially for C/C++ developers.

Object-Oriented â€“ Everything is treated as an object, promoting modular and reusable code.

Platform-Independent â€“ "Write once, run anywhere" via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Secure â€“ Strong security features like bytecode verification, sandboxing, and lack of pointers.

Robust â€“ Emphasizes early error checking, exception handling, and garbage collection.

Multithreaded â€“ Built-in support for multithreaded programming (concurrent execution).

Architecture-Neutral â€“ Compiled code is not dependent on hardware or OS architecture.

Portable â€“ Java programs can move easily from one system to another.

High Performance â€“ Though slower than native languages, it's optimized with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

Distributed â€“ Designed for building distributed applications (e.g., via RMI, sockets).

Dynamic â€“ Can adapt to evolving environments and load classes at runtime.
