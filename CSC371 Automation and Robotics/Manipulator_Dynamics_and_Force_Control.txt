Manipulator Dynamics and Force Control
--------------------------------------

Manipulator dynamics and force control are key areas in robotics that deal with controlling the motion 
and forces exerted by robotic arms or manipulators. This involves both understanding the forces and 
torques acting on the manipulator and managing its interaction with the environment. Here, we will go 
through the theoretical and mathematical foundations in detail.

1. Manipulator Dynamics
-----------------------

Manipulator dynamics involve studying how the motion of a manipulator is affected by forces and torques. 
It considers parameters such as joint configurations, mass, inertia, and external forces. The dynamic 
model is often derived using **Newton-Euler** or **Lagrangian mechanics**, with the Lagrangian approach 
being common due to its compact mathematical form.

1.1 Derivation of Equations of Motion
-------------------------------------

The dynamic behavior of a manipulator with n degrees of freedom (DOF) can be described by the following 
joint-space equation of motion:

M(q) * q_ddot + C(q, q_dot) * q_dot + G(q) = tau

where:
- q is the vector of joint positions (angles for revolute joints or displacements for prismatic joints).
- M(q): Inertia matrix, which depends on the configuration q.
- C(q, q_dot) * q_dot: Coriolis and centripetal forces matrix, accounting for effects due to rotational motion.
- G(q): Gravity vector, representing the gravitational effects on each link.
- tau: Vector of joint torques/forces.

This model is derived using **Lagrangian mechanics**, where the Lagrangian L is defined as the difference 
between the kinetic and potential energies:

L = T - U

1.1.1 Kinetic Energy (T)

The kinetic energy for each link includes both translational and rotational components. For link i, 
the translational kinetic energy is:

T_trans = (1/2) * m_i * v_i^2

where m_i is the mass of link i and v_i is the velocity of the center of mass of link i.

The rotational kinetic energy is given by:

T_rot = (1/2) * omega_i^T * I_i * omega_i

where omega_i is the angular velocity of link i, and I_i is its inertia tensor.

1.1.2 Potential Energy (U)

The potential energy is due to gravity and depends on the height of each link’s center of mass:

U = sum(m_i * g * h_i)

where h_i is the height of the center of mass of link i.

1.1.3 Lagrange's Equation

The equations of motion are obtained by applying **Euler-Lagrange** equations:

d/dt(dL/d(q_dot_i)) - dL/d(q_i) = tau_i

This produces the system of differential equations governing the dynamics of the manipulator.

1.2 Terms in the Dynamics Equation
----------------------------------

- Inertia Matrix M(q): This symmetric matrix characterizes the mass and inertia of each link in relation 
  to the configuration q. It captures coupling effects between joints, meaning motion in one joint affects 
  others.
  
- Coriolis and Centripetal Terms C(q, q_dot): These terms account for forces resulting from joint velocities 
  and help maintain stability, especially at high speeds.

- Gravity Vector G(q): This vector represents the effect of gravity on each joint, and it is configuration-dependent.

2. Force Control in Manipulators
--------------------------------

Force control allows a manipulator to interact with external environments by regulating the force it exerts. 
This control is particularly relevant in applications where the manipulator must touch, grasp, or move objects 
with precision.

2.1 Types of Force Control

2.1.1 Impedance Control

Impedance control regulates the dynamic relationship between the force applied by the manipulator and its 
resulting motion. Instead of directly controlling force or position, impedance control defines a desired 
“virtual” stiffness, damping, and inertia that characterizes how the manipulator should respond to external forces.

F = K * (x_d - x) + B * x_dot

where:
- F is the exerted force.
- x_d is the desired position.
- x is the current position.
- K is the stiffness matrix, akin to a spring constant.
- B is the damping matrix, providing a resistive force.

2.1.2 Hybrid Position/Force Control

Hybrid control combines both position and force control by decomposing the manipulator's task space into 
position-controlled and force-controlled directions. For instance, in a surface contact scenario, the manipulator 
may control force perpendicular to the surface (force control) while maintaining a precise position along the 
plane (position control).

2.2 Force Control Mathematics

To exert a specific force at the end-effector, joint torques must be calculated. This involves the **Jacobian** 
matrix J, which maps joint velocities to end-effector velocities. For force control, the Jacobian transpose 
relates forces at the end-effector to joint torques:

tau = J^T * F

where:
- tau is the vector of joint torques.
- F is the desired force at the end-effector.
- J^T is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix.

2.2.1 Example of Force Control in a 2-Link Manipulator

For a 2-link manipulator exerting a force F at its end-effector, the desired forces in the Cartesian x and y 
directions can be computed as follows:

1. Define the Jacobian J for the manipulator, mapping joint angles to end-effector position.
2. Calculate joint torques tau that produce the required end-effector force by computing J^T * F.

Summary of Steps in Manipulator Dynamics and Force Control
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Dynamic Modeling:
   - Use Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion.
   - Identify terms such as inertia, Coriolis, and gravity forces.
  
2. Force Control Strategies:
   - Select a suitable force control strategy (e.g., impedance control, hybrid position/force control) 
     based on task requirements.
   - For impedance control, set desired stiffness and damping values to achieve compliant behavior.
  
3. Applying Control Laws:
   - Translate desired forces or positions into joint torques through the Jacobian transpose, ensuring 
     the desired end-effector interaction.

Manipulator dynamics and force control provide a sophisticated mathematical framework for robotic manipulation, 
enabling precise control over motion and interaction with external objects. This allows robotic arms to perform 
complex tasks with both accuracy and adaptability, supporting applications across manufacturing, surgery, and more.
